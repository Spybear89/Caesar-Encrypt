# Caesar-Encrypt-4.0
This contains the .exe file for my app Caesar Encrypt.

NOTE: Please keep the Icon.ico file in the same place as the .exe file, this makes sure that when you run the file it has an icon on the QWidget

EDIT: The app isn't a virus, I swear. On Windows just click "Run Anyway" if says that windows protected your PC
